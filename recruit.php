	<p style=" margin: 0;">The quality of care depends on the quality of resources. Senior care is sensitive domain and
resources are always required to be on top of their game and best behaviour. IVH understands the
challenges of the domain and train our resources in-house before exposing them to the clients.</p>
<p class="phy"><b>Care Managers</b></p>
	<p style=" margin: 0;">Care Managers are ex-defence personnel who are recruited through our tie-ups with Army Welfare
Placement Organisation (AWPO), Indian Naval Placement Agency (INPA), and Indian Airforce
Placement Cell (IAPC). After recruitment they go under basic healthcare training to make them
familiar with the healthcare domain. Once ready for deployment, care managers are attached to a
family where they are responsible for handling all eldercare requirements of the elderly.</p><br>
<p style=" margin: 0;">Although all care managers don’t come from healthcare background but they bring with them
qualities like trust, punctuality, hard work, dedication. Administrative skill are always cherry on the
top. Seniors raise their requests through their care managers who then oversee the smooth
resolution of the problem.</p><br>
<p style=" margin: 0;">Care Managers often give surprise visits at client homes to audit the IVH SeniorCare services, which
helps us maintaining and improving our quality standards.</p><br>
<p class="phy"><b>Home Managers</b></p>
<p style=" margin: 0;">Home Managers are hired from a hospital background and oversee the assessment and deployment
of the medical attendants to the clients. Before bringing them into the system, they are trained to
polish their communication skills. Clients who don’t have a care manager subscription have home
managers as their point of contact.</p><br>
<p class="phy"><b>Care Givers</b></p>
<p style=" margin: 0;">Care givers are allied health professional who are hired in their initial years of professional lives
through campus recruitment. Our talent acquisition team travel to various colleges and hand-pick
quality resources to be inducted in the company. Once hired, care givers are trained in-house to
upgrade their skill set to IVH SeniorCare standards.IVH SeniorCare has a dedicated team and facility for the training of care managers, home managers,
and care givers.</p><br>
